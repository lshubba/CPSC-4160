Motivation:
I chose pong as a simple starting point in my game development journey
within this class. I knew pong was a simple game that could be coded quickly
but also was a game that I could add more complexity (such as multiple balls, 
smarter ai, more precise collisions, etc) if I wanted to. I wouldn't say I was 
inspired by anything to make it, but I would say that it is a good starting point
to see what I'm capable of. 


Reasoning:
I set it up with the Model View Controller format because it was required,
but also because it helps break down the different components within the game.
I also chose to split each into their own file for organization's sake and to 
break down the responsibilities of the Model, View, and Controller.

Future Work:
To improve the game, I could make the ai better
add a new mode that includes two balls instead of one
add a two player mode
make more precise collisions
add a win condition
add a victory screen
add customization (paddle color, ball color)
